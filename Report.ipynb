    "Each year, A huge number of tourists travel around the world to discover new places. Doing so, they generate lots of money and stakeholders might want to benefit from that tourism. Thatâ€™s why it might be interesting for them to know what makes a city more attractive than another one or if there are any relationships between the most attractive cities in the world. For example, someone owning a business in tourism might want to extend his business in a city similar to the one where he currently works, hoping that would give him the same opportunities and benefits. Also, such a knowledge can benefit not only the stakeholders but also the tourists. Indeed, a tourist might have once travelled to a city and liked it. Therefore, for his next vacation, he would like to go to a similar place.\n",

    "Consequently, if we try to resolve such a problem, we remark that we can group the most visited cities in the world into clusters and study what features they share. So as a junior data scientist, we will try to uncover why the 100 most visited cities are so attractive to tourists and what do those cities have in common\n"
